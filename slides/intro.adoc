=== Why should developers care?

- A clean, safe, hygienic, portable runtime environment for your app.
- No worries about missing dependencies, packages and other pain points during subsequent deployments.
- Run each app in its own isolated container, so you can run various versions of libraries and other dependencies for each app without worrying.
- Automate testing, integration, packaging...anything you can script.
- Reduce/eliminate concerns about compatibility on different platforms, either your own or your customers.
- Cheap, zero-penalty containers to deploy services. A VM without the overhead of a VM. Instant replay and reset of image snapshots.

=== Why should sysadmins care?

Configure once... run anything

- Make the entire lifecycle more efficient, consistent, and repeatable
- Increase the quality of code produced by developers.
- Eliminate inconsistencies between development, test, production, and customer environments.
- Support segregation of duties.
- Significantly improves the speed and reliability of continuous deployment and continuous integration systems.
- Because the containers are so lightweight, address significant performance, costs, deployment, and portability issues normally associated with VMs.

=== Why should DevOps care?

== Docker Architecture

=== Separation of Concerns

== More Technical Details

[.column.x-small]
.Why
--
- Run everywhere
** Regardless of kernel version
** Regardless of host distro
** Physical or virtual, cloud or not
** Container and host architecture must match...

- Run anything
** If it can run on the host, it can run in the container
** If it can on a Linux kernel, it can run in the container
--

[.column.x-small]
.what
--
- High level: a lightweight VM
** Own process space
** Own network interface
** Can run stuff as root
** Can have its own /sbin/init (different from host)
** "machine container"

- Low level: chroot on steroids
** Can also _not_ have its own /sbin/init
** Container = isolated processes
** Share kernel with host
** No device emulation</li>
** "application container"

== Demo

=== Docker Installation

See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

=== Docker Hello World


 $ docker run hello-world

=== Docker run Ubuntu

 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

NOTE: `-it` is for interactive mode

----
> docker run -it ubuntu bash
root@38d443191a31:/# 
----

=== Docker run Fedora

 $ docker run -it fedora bash

----
> docker run -it fedora bash
[root@ea2c31dc8dcd /]# cat /etc/redhat-release 
Fedora release 36 (Thirty Six)
[root@ea2c31dc8dcd /]#

=== Anatomy of the docker command line

- action: `run`, `pull`, `push`, `ps`
- options: `-it`, `-d`, `-p`, `-v`, `--rm`...
- container: `ubuntu`, `fedora` ...
- command: `bash`, `ls`, `ps` ...

=== Docker run Ubuntu with a volume

 $ docker run -it -v /tmp:/tmp ubuntu bash

=== Hey I have lots of Docker contaienrs running

 $ docker ps -a

NOTE: Use `docker stop` to stop a container using the ID or name

 $ docker stop <container-id>
 $ docker stop <container-name>

NOTE: Use `docker --rm` to stop and remove a container after it exits

 $ docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash
