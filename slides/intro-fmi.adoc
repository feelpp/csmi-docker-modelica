Challenges for Functional Mock-up:

- Different tools and languages are involved
- No standards for model interface and co-simulation available
- Protection of model IP and know-how of supplier

=== FMI Main design idea


[.column.small]
--
- A component which implements the interface is called a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU)

* Separation of:
** Description of interface data: XML file
** Functionality: Application Programming Interface (API) in C

* An FMU is a zipped file (*.fmu) containing:
** modelDescription.xml
** Implementation in source and/or binary form
** Additional data and functionality

=== FMI Model Description

.Model description stored in an XML file

- Instantiation:

    fmiComponent fmilnstantiate (fmiString instanceName, ...)

- Returns an instance of the FMU. Returned `fmicomponent` is an argument of the other interface functions.
- Functions for initialization, termination, destruction
- Support of real, integer, boolean, and string inputs, outputs, parameters
- `Set` and `Get`` functions for each type:
]source,c++]
----
    fmiStatus fmiSetReal (fmiComponent c,
                          const fmivalueReference vr [] , size t nvr,
                          const fmireal value [])
    fmistatus fmisetinteger(fmicomponent $c$,
                            const fmivalueReference vr[], size t nvr,
                            const fmilnteger value[])
----
- Identification by valueReference, defined in the XML description file for each variable

== FMI for Model Exchange

=== Features

[.small]
--
- Functionality of state of the art modeling methods can be expressed
- Support of continuous-time and discrete-time systems
- Model is described by differential, algebraic, discrete equations
- Interface for solution of hybrid Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)
- Handling of time, state and step events, event iteration
- Discarding of invalid inputs, state variables
- No explicit function call for computation of model algorithm
- FMU decides which part is to be computed, when a `fmi2get` Xxx function is called
- Allows for efficient caching algorithms

=== Data Exchange

== FMI for Co-Simulation

[.columns]
=== Features

[.column.x-small]
--
Motivation

- Simulation of heterogeneous systems
- Partitioning and parallelization of large systems
- Multirate integration
- Hardware-in-the-loop simulation

Definition:

- Coupling of several simulation tools
- Each tool treats one part of a modular coupled problem
- Data exchange is restricted to discrete communication points
- Subsystems are solved independently between communication points

=== FMI for Co-Simulation

* FMI enables sophisticated Co-Simulation Master Algorithms:
** Optional variable communication step size
** Optional higher-order approximation of inputs and outputs
** Optional repetition of communication steps
- Capabilities of the slave are contained in the XML-file
- Master can decide which coupling algorithm is applicable

**Tools which do not support all features are not excluded**

- Asynchronous execution (allows for parallel execution)

=== Data Exchange

[NOTE]
.Additional features
--
- Status information
- Derivatives of inputs, outputs w.r.t. time for support of higher order approximation between communication steps
